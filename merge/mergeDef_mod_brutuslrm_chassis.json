It compares well to other fusion engine-equipped tanks of similar weight and role like the Von Luckner and Manticore, though unlike its contemporaries it carries relatively light armor in exchange for a heavier weapons array. This variant delivers long-range fires with two LRM20s and six tons of ammo.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Tracked: High traction, agile turning.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 3/5 Hex: 90/150 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>        220     40\n<b>Left</b>          185     40\n<b>Right</b>        185     40\n<b>Rear</b>         140     40\n<b>Turret</b>       185     40\n\n<b>Total</b>      915    200\n",
